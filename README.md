# Build Your Own Shell (Python)

This repository contains a basic implementation of a POSIX compatible shell in Python. It can interpret simple commands, run external programs and handle built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd` and `echo`.

## Running locally

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Execute `./your_program.sh` to start the shell defined in `app/main.py`.

Feel free to extend the implementation to learn more about shell command parsing, REPLs and implementing additional built-ins.
